-- attenuating an existing one), and 'Sealed' is obtained by sealing an open
-- biscuit

-- case, we can have parsed tokens which signatures have /not/ been verified. In order to
-- accidentally forgetting to check signatures, parsed biscuits keep track of whether the
-- signatures have been verified with a dedicated type parameter, which can be instantiated with
-- two types: 'Verified' and 'Unverified'. 'Verified' additionally keeps track of the 'PublicKey'
-- that has been used to verify the signatures.
